# sportBetRushArbitrage


## Official Game Description
Rush is a tren-ball crash game. The game involves a car moving continuously in a city landscape before leaving. The game play is simple as follows:
- Player selects a Target Coefficient that they think will be achieved by the Car.
- Player then selects their Bet Amount.
- Player can place their bet manually by clicking on the “Place Bet” button or click on “Auto” button to enable automatic bets. The Target Coefficient and the Bet Amount set when the Auto Bet is turned on will be considered for all Auto Bets until the player stops the Auto Bet.

## WHat I have noticed
- There are cases where the multiplier ends on 1.00X contrary to the official description that ["The winning House Coefficient starts at 1.01x and keeps on increasing as the car speeds up and moves ahead."]
